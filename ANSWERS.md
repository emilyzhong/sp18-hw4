## Questions

1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?

new doesn't save the object you created but create does!

2. What command followed after with `Cat.new` will emulate the same behavior as `Cat.create`?

`Cat.save`

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

id

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?

`Cat.create(name: "Kira")`

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?

It was alright, although I felt like there could've been more examples in the slides (a lot of looking up stuff in ruby guides as opposed to referencing lecture slides)
